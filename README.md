# Farooq Shah

I'm a developer in the making. Currently deep into Python and data science, building things on the web, and learning through doing rather than waiting until I feel ready.

## What I'm working on

Right now I'm going through a structured six-month Python and data science program — covering everything from the fundamentals to actual machine learning concepts. Alongside that I'm involved with DevSil, a mentorship community where people learn together and help each other move forward.

I also built my own portfolio from scratch, which is still a work in progress like most things worth caring about.

## Skills I'm building

- Python — getting comfortable with it every day
- Data science — pandas, numpy, visualization, the whole pipeline
- HTML and CSS — I can build and style things on the web
- Learning how to actually finish projects, not just start them

## Where I'm at

Student. Still learning. Not trying to pretend otherwise. I'm building in public because that's the only way to actually get better.

If you're on a similar path, feel free to reach out.
